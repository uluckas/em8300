/* Everything you wanted to know about band structure */
/*
 * The entire frequency domain is represented by 256 real
 * floating point fourier coefficients. Only the lower 253
 * coefficients are actually utilized however. We use arrays
 * of 256 to be efficient in some cases.
 *
 * The 5 full bandwidth channels (fbw) can have their higher
 * frequencies coupled together. These coupled channels then
 * share their high frequency components.
 *
 * This coupling band is broken up into 18 sub-bands starting
 * at mantissa number 37. Each sub-band is 12 bins wide.
 *
 * There are 50 bit allocation sub-bands which cover the entire
 * frequency range. The sub-bands are of non-uniform width, and
 * approximate a 1/6 octave scale.
