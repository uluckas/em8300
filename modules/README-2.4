The Makefile is now defaulted to kernel 2.4.x
All that is necessary is the following:

make
make install

For users running devfs (i.e. Mandrake 8.1), cat /proc/filesystems,
if it mentions devfs you are likely running it:
You need to tell the devfs daemon (referred to as devfsd) to create symlinks
to support the old naming scheme. This is handled different on different
distros, for example debian places it's entries in /etc/devfs/compat_symlinks,
gentoo places it in /etc/devfs.conf. For your particular distro you will have
to find out yourself (and please notify us so we can add info on it in this
doc and maybe one day compile a script to automate the process).
Anyway, the lines that are supposed to go into this config file are in the
devfs_symlinks file located in this dir, you will probably figure out how
it works. If not, don't worry, just add those lines to your devfs config
and restart devfsd (usually "killall -HUP devfsd") and you'll be just fine.

If you get an error message saying "mtrr_reg undeclared" or similar try updating
your kernel. Old 2.2 and 2.4 kernels seems to have a bug with it's mtrr code
(whether you use it or not).

If sound is configured in your kernel, the driver will register a /dev/dsp
device.
