Debian README for em8300 package

INSTALL

To get started you must have the modules compiled, which they aren't at this moment I guess.

Change to your sourcetree where the source is installed.

# cd /usr/src/

Untar the source

# tar xvzf em8300.tar.gz

# cd modules/em8300

Build a debian-package

# debian/rules binary-modules

Install modules

# dpkg -i ../em8300-modules-<kvers>_0.8-1.deb

The next thing to do is uploading the microcode unless the player handles this automatic. Xine 0.5 doesn't

# microcode_upload.pl /etc/dxr3.ux

This should be all
