The Makefile is now defaulted to kernel 2.4.x
All that is necessary is the following:

make
make install

If your kernel sources are in a location other than /usr/src/linux
you need to modify the second line of the Makefile.  If you need
to build with a compiler other than gcc (i.e. kgcc), modify line 8.

If you get "em8300.o: unresolved symbol register_sound_dsp" you either
need to enable audio support in your kernel, load the soundcore module,
or disable registration of /dev/dsp in the driver by removing
-DREGISTER_DSP from EXTRA_CFLAGS in the Makefile.
