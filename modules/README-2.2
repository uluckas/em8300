If you would like to build the modules for 2.2.x kernels
just overwrite Makefile with Makefile.2.2

cp Makefile.2.2 Makefile
make
make install

If your kernel sources are in a location other than /usr/src/linux
you need to modify the second line of the Makefile.

If you have configured sound support in your kernel and want the driver
to register a /dev/dsp device, edit the Makefile and add -DREGISTER_DSP
to EXTRA_CFLAGS
