The Makefile is now defaulted to kernel 2.4.x
All that is necessary is the following:

make
make install

If you are using devfs edit the file /etc/devfs/compat_symlinks and add
the lines described in the file devfs_symlinks in this dir

If sound is configured in your kernel, the driver will register a /dev/dsp
device.
