To compile the modules under 2.4.x kernels you will need to run the script:
	./make-modules-2.4

If your kernel sources are not in /usr/src/linux then edit the make-modules-2.4
script at the top to change where the correct location is.

Also, if you are not executing the script from within your em8300/modules
directory, you will, again, need to edit the script and change the
EM_LOCATION=`pwd` to EM_LOCATION=/whatever/your/path/is/em8300/modules.

Now run the script and if all goes well, you should find the compiled modules
in your em8300/modules directory! (-:

For this to work you need to have configured your kernel and done a make dep,
before running the script. (A make bzImage and make modules is not necessary
but since the modules need to be compiled for the same kernel that they will
be used under it doesn't make sense not to have done a make bzImage (or
equivalent) and a make modules at least at some point in the past...)

Let me know if you have any problems using the script...

I verified it to work fine on kernels 2.4.0-ac9 and -ac10.
