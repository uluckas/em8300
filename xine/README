Introduction
============

This directory contains the Xine 0.5 plugin for dxr3 support
The Xine 0.4.x patches are now located at
http://dxr3.sourceforge.net/download/xine

This is still a work in progress.  Audio output currently does
not use the dxr3 device, although the oss ioctl's are in the cvs
version of the drivers.  You can symlink /dev/em8300_ma to /dev/dsp
to try it.

Getting and compiling XINE 0.5 CVS
==================================

cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.xine.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/xine co xine-lib
cd xine-lib
./cvscompile.sh --prefix=/tmp/xine
make
make install
cd ..

cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.xine.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/xine co xine-ui
cd xine-ui
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/tmp/xine/lib \
	./cvscompile.sh --prefix=/tmp/xine --with-xine-prefix=/tmp/xine
make
make install
cd ..

Installation of the dxr3 plugin
===============================

You'll need to edit the Makefile to specify your xine src patch and
xine installation path.

cd em8300/xine    # = this directory
make
make install
cd ..

cd modules
./ldm
../scripts/microcode_upload.pl /etc/dxr3.ux

XINE configuration
==================

XINE has several configuration options in $HOME/.xinerc

Some of them are important for dxr3 playback:
*) dxr3_tvmode:
	default Keep the current driver setting
	ntsc    NTSC 60Hz
	pal     PAL 50Hz
	pal60   PAL 60Hz
	
*) video_driver_name:
	dxr3    Usually default if available, should be set to
	        dxr3 if not.

It is recommented to run XINE one time before configuring it,
since all options get written in .xinerc and have their default
values. The dummy video driver can be forced using the "-V dxr3"
command line option. Only the tvmode value has to be edited
if the default driver setting is not correct.

Running XINE
============

/tmp/xine/bin/xine

Help on command line options can be obtained with
