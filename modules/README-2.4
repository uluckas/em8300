The Makefile is now defaulted to kernel 2.4.x
All that is necessary is the following:

make
make install

If your kernel sources are in a location other than /usr/src/linux
you need to modify the second line of the Makefile.  If you need
to build with a compiler other than gcc (i.e. kgcc), modify line 8.

If sound is configured in your kernel, the driver will register a /dev/dsp
device.
