To compile the modules under 2.4.x kernels you will need to run the script:
switch-to-2.4. (This is only necessary for the first compilation after 
checking out the driver source from CVS.)

If your kernel sources are not in /usr/src/linux then edit the switch-to-2.4
script at the top to change where the correct location is.

NB: You need to have write access to the main directory of your kernel sources
    otherwise the patch will fail!

Also, if you are not executing the script from within your em8300/modules
directory, you will need to edit the switch-to-2.4 script at the top and
change the EM_LOCATION=`pwd` to EM_LOCATION=/your/path/em8300/modules.

Now run the script: ./switch-to-2.4

Finally change into the linux kernel directory (/usr/src/linux) and do a:
	make modules

Go back to the em8300/modules directory and you should find the compiled
modules there! (-:

For this to work you need to have configured your kernel and done a make dep,
followed by a make bzImage (or equivalent) before the make modules of course.

Hope this is helpful.
